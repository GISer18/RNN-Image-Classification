# RNN-Image-Classification
A Remote Sensing Image Classification Tool based on RNN.

I had implemented the algorithms of Machine Learning for remote sensing image classification using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network).
I had also made GUI (Graphical User Interface) using Python for the same. 
This GUI facilitates to provide information to the model like input image, epochs, threshold value, training data, various layers of RNN, saving weights and output. 
I had successfully tested the algorithm, working with different bands combination of multispectral images.
